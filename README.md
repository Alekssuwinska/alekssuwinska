## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently expanding knowledge in Big Data and Advanced Analytics at Warsaw School of Economics. Through various projects and academic studies, I am gaining hands-on experience with tools like Databricks, Oracle SQL, Python, and R. Eager to apply analytical techniques to real-world problems and continuously expand knowledge in data science and big data.
